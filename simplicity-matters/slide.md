Simplicity Matters
Rich Hickey

----
Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability
Edsger W. Dijkstra

----
Word Origins

- Simple
  sim- plex
  one fold/braid
  vs complex

- Easy
  ease < aise < adjacens
  lie near
  vs hard

----
Simple

- One fold/braid
  - One role
  - One task
  - One concept
  - One dimension

- But not
  - One instance
  - One operation
- About lack of interleaving, not cardinality
- Objective

----
Easy

- Near, at hand
  - on our hand drive, in our tool set, IDE, apt get, gem install
- Near to our understanding/skill set
  - familiar
- Near our capabilities
- Easy is relative
- familiar

----
Limits

- We can only hope to make reliable those things we can understand
- We can only consider a few things at a time
- Interwined things must be considered together
- Complexity undermines understanding

----
Change

- Do more, Do it differently, Do it better
- Changes to software require analysis and decisions
- Your ability to reason about your program is critical
  - More than tests, types, tools, process

----
Simplicity = Opportunity

- Architectural Agility wins
  - else - push the elephant
- Design is about pulling things apart
- Repurpose, substitute, move, combine, extend
          
----
LISP programmers know the value of everything and the cost of nothing.
Alan Perlis

----
Programmers know the benefits of everything and the tradeoffs of nothing.

----
Programmers vs Programs

- We focus on ourselves
  - programmer convenience
  - programmer replaceability
- Rather than the programs
  - software quality, correctness
  - maintenance, change
- gem install hairball

----
Complect

- To interleave, entwine, braid
- Don’t do it!
  - Complecting things is the source of complexity
- Best to avoid in the first place

----
Making Things Easy

- Bring to hand by installing
  -  getting approved for use
- Become familiar by learning, trying
- But mental capability?
  - not going to move very far
- Make challenges easy by simplifying them

----
We can be creating the exact same programs out of significantly simpler components

What’s in your Toolkit?

|Complexity|Simplicity|
|State, Objects|Values|
|Methods|Functions,Namespaces|
|Inheritance, switch, matching|Polymorphism ala carte|
|Syntax|Data|
|Imperative loops, fold|Set functions|
|Actors|Queues|
|ORM|Declarative data manipulation|
|Conditionals|Rules|
|Inconsistency|Consistency|

~~Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.~~

Simplicity is not an objective in art, but one achieves simplicity despite one's self by entering into the real sense of things
Constantin Brancusi

Simple

- One fold/braid
  - One role
  - One task
  - One concept
  - One dimension

- But not
  - One instance
  - One operation
- About lack of interleaving, not cardinality
- Objective

----
Easy

- Near, at hand
  - on our hand drive, in our tool set, IDE, apt get, gem install
- Near to our understanding/skill set
  - familiar
- Near our capabilities
- Easy is relative
- familiar

----
Limits

- We can only hope to make reliable those things we can understand
- We can only consider a few things at a time
- Interwined things must be considered together
- Complexity undermines understanding

----
Change

- Do more, Do it differently, Do it better
- Changes to software require analysis and decisions
- Your ability to reason about your program is critical
  - More than tests, types, tools, process
